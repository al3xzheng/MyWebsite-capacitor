                This is a ceramic through-hole capacitor I designed with the maximum capacitance of a 3 digit capacitor code! It is quite simple but sleek and was relatively
                quite tricky to design.
                <br>
                Due to my interest in Hardware, I was inspired to design and create this so that I could 3-d print it and keep it as a collectible. It was 3-d printed using
                its g-code and Cura.
